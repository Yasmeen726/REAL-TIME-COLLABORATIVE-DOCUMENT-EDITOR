##Task Description:

This project involves building a real-time collaborative document editor, similar to Google Docs, using web technologies. The core functionality centers around enabling multiple users to simultaneously edit a shared document, with changes instantly reflected across all connected clients.

Key Features:

Real-Time Collaborative Editing: The primary feature is to allow multiple users to edit the same document concurrently. Any changes made by one user should be immediately visible to all other connected users.
This necessitates implementing a robust mechanism for synchronizing document state across clients.

Text Editing Functionality: Users should be able to type, delete, and modify text within the document. Basic text editing capabilities, such as cursor placement and selection, are essential.

User Presence: A visual representation of connected users should be displayed, indicating who is currently editing the document. This could be achieved through a user list or visual cursors.

Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDTs: Implement either Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to handle concurrent edits and resolve conflicts. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency when multiple users modify the document simultaneously.

Backend Infrastructure: Develop a backend server using Node.js and Socket.IO to facilitate real-time communication between clients. The backend should handle document storage, synchronization, and conflict resolution.

Frontend Interface: Create a user-friendly frontend interface using React (or a similar framework). The frontend should provide a text editing area, user presence indicators, and potentially a basic toolbar for formatting.

Document Persistence (Optional): Implement a mechanism for saving and retrieving documents from a database or file system. This allows users to access previously created documents.

Basic Formatting (Optional): Add basic formatting options, such as bold, italic, and underline, to enhance the editing experience.

Technical Requirements:

Frontend: React (or Vue, Angular), WebSocket API
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): A suitable algorithm or library for conflict resolution.
Document Storage (Optional): A database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) or file system.
Development Process:

Backend Setup: Begin by setting up the backend server and implementing the core communication logic using Socket.IO.
Frontend Integration: Integrate the frontend with the backend, establishing a WebSocket connection.
Text Editing Implementation: Implement the basic text editing functionality in the frontend.
Operational Transformation/CRDT Implementation: Implement the chosen conflict resolution mechanism.
User Presence Implementation: Add user presence indicators to the frontend.
Testing and Refinement: Thoroughly test the application and refine the implementation as needed.
Optional Features: Implement document persistence and basic formatting if time permits.
The goal of this project is to create a functional and reliable real-time collaborative document editor that demonstrates the core principles of concurrent editing and data synchronization.
